# Introduction

This Eclipse plugin is designed to aid in the generation of C++ classes that utilise the Google C++ Testing Framework (https://code.google.com/p/googletest/) to run automated tests.

The wizard extends the CDT New Class Wizard by adding properties to the new class that default to the Google framework (eg: a default base class).

Pull Requests are welcome as are suggestions for extra features.
